This solution demonstrated handling of background operations using
helper-primitives based on FCL BackgroundWorker class.

Projects in solution:
---------------------
- BOM.dll		- background operations management helpers class library with helper-primitives:
	- DoWorkEmbeddedHelper	- helper-primitive that using controls embedded in main window (Windows.Forms)
	- DoWorkSimpleDialog	- helper-primitive that using simple modal dialog (Windows.Forms)
	- Delay					- origin relative delay helper with background operation cancelled state check
- TestEmbedded	- test application for DoWorkEmbeddedHelper primitive.
- TestDialog	- test application for DoWorkSimpleDialog primitive.
